# chess engine in development
we used 64 bit integer bitboards to represent chess positions and used bitwise operations for logic
to make a very efficient move generator which will be used to quickly check many positions for the chess engine.
to test it out, run make run and it will prompt you to enter a FEN position,
then it will print out all legal moves.
